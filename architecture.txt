Game Plan:

Each player has:
- a location attribute in the form of a coordinate (x,y)
- whether it has the ball in the form of a boolean
- every second, each player decides how s/he should act

Player actions include
- intercept
- run
   - expressed as a vector, with the magnitude being the speed and the direction
     being the direction
- pass
- shoot

The ball has:
- a location attribute in the form of a coordinate (x,y)
- the speed and direction it's going in the form of a vector

Training Plan:
- going near the ball = reward
- intercepting the ball = bigger reward
- having the ball taken from you = punishment

Have a transition function that takes an action, a state (everything happening at the moment; a snapshot in time), a specific player this is intended for, and returns a new action for this specific player

We plan on doing policy iteration to train the agents. Not sure how though.

We should have a while loop that keeps calling the transition function, which requires a reward function.
